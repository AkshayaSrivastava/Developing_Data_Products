Why Model Rockets?
========================================================

- Rockets have been around since the ancient chinese developed gunpowder and used 
it to make fireworks, albeit not in it's curent form

- Model Rocketry has been regarded as an educative tool and has been credited with
helping many budding scientists and engineers find thier roots.

- Model Rocketry involves building a complex rocket (duh), and as sucb, the 
calculations can become very tedios. Thus, every little bit of help is appreciated.

Ok, so where does Parchute Sizing Utility come in?
========================================================

* The sizing utility allows a user to calculated how much parachute they would need
for a safe recovery.

* It is can take into account:
    * Motor size (which leads to the height)
    * Weight (the mass of the rocket)
    * Profile of the rocket (the coefficient of drag, or Cd)
    * Wind speed

Is that all it does?
========================================================

- Well...yes. 

- The tool also assumes a standard atmosphere and a static air density. It also
assumes that the landing speed is fixed at 20 feet/second

- At this point, we don't have the funding to put out a product that can handle
more difficult computations.

Oh! Well, when can we expect those newfangled thingamabobs?
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
altitude_m<-seq(from=0, to=1000, by=5)
dry_lapse_rate<--9.8*altitude_m/1000+25
wet_lapse_rate<--5*altitude_m/1000+25
plot(altitude_m,dry_lapse_rate,xlab='Altitude (m)', ylab='Temperature (ËšC)', main='Lapse Rate Comparison', type="l", col="red")
lines(altitude_m,wet_lapse_rate,col="blue")
legend("bottomleft",c("Dry Lapse Rate","Wet Lapse Rate"), lwd=1, col=c("red","blue"))
```
***
Some of the difficulties in implementing new features are intricate calculations
involving the estimated humidity of air and the height, which would lead to a 
changing pressure and density upon decent. As the graph shows, 0% humidity and 
30% humidity are vastly different, empirically.

So what you're saying is...?
========================================================

- There are many improvements down the line. 

- Involve solving complex problems and equations that are not trivial to solve
and highly depend on the assumptions made.

- More funding is necessary in order to complete the product with all of the 
various features and calculations.
